db.zoo.insert({name: 'Cleo', species: 'jaguar', age: 12, hobbies: ['sleeping', 'eating', 'climbing']})
db.zoo.insert({name: 'Banzai', species: 'fox', age: 1, hobbies: ['sleeping', 'eating', 'playing']})
db.zoo.insert({name: 'beastie1', species: 'lion', age: 7, hobbies: ['sleeping', 'eating', 'playing','clawing']})
db.zoo.insert({name: 'beastie2', species: 'tiger', age: 5, hobbies: ['sleeping', 'eating', 'playing','meuling']})
db.zoo.insert({name: 'beastie3', species: 'bear', age: 1, hobbies: ['sleeping', 'eating', 'playing','honey']})

show collections

db.zoo.find()

Documents can also be deleted or dropped. The syntax to do so follows: 
db.collectionName.remove({})
So, if we wanted to remove Cleo from the database, we would update that line of code to:
db.zoo.remove({name: 'Cleo'})
We can also empty the collection at once, instead of one document at a time. For example, to empty our pets collection, we would type: 
db.zoo.remove({})
Because the inner curly brackets are empty, Mongo will assume that we want everything in our pets collection to be removed.
Additionally, to remove a collection all together, we would use 
db.zoo.drop()
After running that line in the shell, our pets collection will no longer exist at all.
And to remove the test database, we will use this line of code: 
db.dropDatabase()
